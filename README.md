# New VM Setup 
## Purpose:
The purpose of this repo is to set up a new kali linux virtual machine to my prefrences 
This script uses pimpmykali in and then downloads some precompiled tools/scripts (yes yes... I know) and set's up how I like my vm to be setup.
The repo also includes my Tmux config and my zsh config.
